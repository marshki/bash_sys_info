# Bash System Info  

Bash script to extract useful information from a `*NIX` host using a menu-driven interface.
Ideally, this script should run in Centos 7, Debian 8, Mac OS X (11), & Ubuntu 16.04.  
Still a WIP.  
# TODO

- [ ] Test on: 
    - [ ] Centos 7
    - [ ] Debian 8
    - [ ] Ubuntu 16.04
    - [ ] Mac OSX 11
- [ ] Fix mem_info badness in Ubuntu (TMI) 
- [ ] Fix os_info in Centos 7 (TLI)
- [ ] user_info should probably yield less info 
- [ ] Defeat more badness as it comes up

# Bash System Info  

Bash script to extract useful information from a `*NIX` host using a menu-driven interface.
Ideally, this script should run in: Centos 7, Debian 8, Mac OS X (11), & Ubuntu 16.04. 
**UPDATE (11.01.2016): ** Will need to fork program and have two distinct branches--one for Linux-based OSs and one for OS X / FreeBSD

Still a WIP.
